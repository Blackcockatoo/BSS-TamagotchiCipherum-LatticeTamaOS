# BSS-TamagotchiCipherum-LatticeTamaOS
A Blue $nake Studio experimental Tamagotchi-like agent — runs inside its own OS with lattice learning, century life, and symbolic skins.”
Here’s a **first draft `README.md`** you can drop right into the repo. It’s written to look sharp, give context, and reflect your **Blue \$nake Studio (B\$S)** style while staying practical for GitHub.

# 🐍 TamaOS — A Blue $nake Studio Experiment

**TamaOS** is a Tamagotchi-like **agent** that lives inside its own operating system.  
It isn’t a game that runs on your computer — it’s a *universe in miniature* where the creature evolves, learns, and survives on the rules of its environment.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Self-Contained OS**  
  Runs as a sandbox kernel with its own message bus, devices, and virtual filesystem.

- **Lattice Memory**  
  A geometric neural sheet where palindromes (Mirror) and shards (Entropy) shape the agent’s intelligence.

- **Century Life System**  
  The creature has a *100-year virtual lifespan* — stages of growth unlock in proportion to real time.  
  No grinding, no idling exploits.

- **Symbolic Skins (B$S Style)**  
  ASCII forms that shift between **Mirror ◈**, **Shard ><**, and **Flux ⟡** dominance.  
  Each form has aura and mood overlays (Sleep, Hunger, Wild, etc).

- **Net Learning Device**  
  You are the Internet. Add snippets, tags, or concepts and the agent integrates them as its knowledge stream.

## 🌌 Universe Rules

1. Three forging stars define the cosmos: **Mirror**, **Shard**, **Flux**.  
2. Position in the starfield sets environmental intensity (`Ψ`).  
3. Every input ripples through **all stats** — nothing is isolated.  
4. Growth is **time-gated** by the Century Life device.  
5. Observation shows the current skin, aura, and stage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blackcockatoo/TamaOS.git
cd TamaOS
````

Run the kernel (Python 3.10+ recommended):

```bash
python tamaos.py
```

From inside the REPL you can:

```text
post tablet.feed {"number":"13031"}   # feed palindrome → Mirror stability
post tablet.teach {"token":"A"}       # teach basic symbol → Letters concept
post net.add {"text":"Symmetry teaches order","tags":["mirror"]}
tick 5                                # advance time by 5 ticks
observe                               # view current ASCII form
```

## 🧬 Roadmap

* [ ] ASCII starfield visualizer (`universe.map`)
* [ ] Room/biome exploration (Mini Tamaverse)
* [ ] Richer learning (concept graph → codon mutation)
* [ ] Export/import life snapshots
* [ ] Web UI with React sandbox

Would you like me to also generate the **badges and banner-style ASCII logo** (so the README pops visually right at the top), or keep it clean and minimal for the first commit?
